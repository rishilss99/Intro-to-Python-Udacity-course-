# Intro-to-Python-Udacity-course-
Collection of codes I wrote while completing the Introduction to Python course on Udacity

This is a much more organised collection on codes which are based on Python 3.
They have a proper structure and are great to practice learning to read code.

P.S. Ask me if you have any queries
